# Bio
My name is Jules Vigy and I am a software engineer that graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a degree in computer science. Originally, I emigrated from France, and in my time in university I found a passion for programming. When I am not working or hacking together personal projects, I love to spend time reading, running, and lifting weights. Occasionally, I enjoy indulging in the fine flavors of life including, but not limited to, champagne and cigars. I would one day hope to consider myself a connoisseur in these pleasures.
