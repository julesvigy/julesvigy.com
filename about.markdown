# <u>Bio</u>

My name is Jules Vigy, and I am a software engineer passionate about building impactful software that benefits humanity. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I deepened my love for programming. Outside of work and personal projects, I enjoy spending time with family, reading, running, and investing. One of my long-term aspirations is to become a [six star finisher](https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/six-star).

# <u>Pet Projects</u>

**[@react-simple-maps](https://github.com/julesvigy/react-simple-maps)** - is an open source project that I founded. The project aspires to provide simple and easy to use maps for [React](https://reactjs.org/). It is currently available for use on npm.
