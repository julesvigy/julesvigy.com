# <u>Bio</u>

My name is Jules Vigy and I am a software engineer that graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a degree in computer science. Originally, I emigrated from France, and in my time in university I solidifed my passion for programming. When I am not working or hacking together personal projects, I enjoy spending time with family, reading, running, skiing, and lifting weights. Occasionally, I enjoy indulging in the fine flavors of life including, but not limited to, haute cusine, champagne, wine, and cigars. I one day aspire to be a [six star finisher](https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/six-star) and a certified sommelier.

# <u>Pet Projects</u>

**[@react-simple-maps](https://github.com/julesvigy/react-simple-maps)** - is an open source project that I founded. The project aspires to provide simple and easy to use maps for [React](https://reactjs.org/). It is currently available for use on npm.
